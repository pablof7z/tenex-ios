# EOSE Implementation Test

## Summary

I've successfully implemented the EOSE (End of Stored Events) waiting mechanism for the 24010 status update subscription in `NostrManager.swift`. 

## Changes Made

1. **Added EOSE tracking**: The implementation now tracks EOSE messages from relays using a `Set<String>` to store which relays have sent their EOSE.

2. **Added flag for status subscription**: A boolean flag `hasStartedStatusSubscription` ensures we only start processing 24010 status events after receiving at least one EOSE.

3. **Parallel monitoring**: The implementation uses a separate Task to monitor `relayUpdates` AsyncStream for EOSE messages while the main loop processes events.

4. **Guard clause**: Events are only processed after EOSE is received, with appropriate logging to show when events are being held back.

## Implementation Details

```swift
// Track EOSE from relays
var receivedEOSE = Set<String>()
var hasStartedStatusSubscription = false

// Monitor relay updates to wait for EOSE
Task {
    for await update in statusSource.relayUpdates {
        switch update {
        case .eose(let relay):
            receivedEOSE.insert(relay)
            if !hasStartedStatusSubscription && !receivedEOSE.isEmpty {
                hasStartedStatusSubscription = true
                print("✅ First EOSE received, starting 24010 status subscription")
            }
        // ... handle other cases
        }
    }
}

// In the main event loop
for await event in statusSource.events {
    guard hasStartedStatusSubscription else {
        print("⏳ Waiting for EOSE before processing status event")
        continue
    }
    // Process event normally...
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents premature status updates**: Ensures we don't process 24010 events before getting the full picture from relays.

2. **Better synchronization**: Guarantees that we have received all stored events before subscribing to real-time status updates.

3. **Improved reliability**: Reduces the chance of missing initial status events or processing them out of order.

## Testing

To test this implementation:

1. Run the app and monitor the console logs
2. Look for the "Monitoring relay updates for EOSE..." message
3. Verify you see "Received EOSE from relay: [relay_url]" messages
4. Confirm you see "First EOSE received, starting 24010 status subscription" before any status events are processed
5. Check that any early status events show "Waiting for EOSE before processing status event"

## Note

The implementation follows NDKSwift's patterns for handling relay updates through the `relayUpdates` AsyncStream, which provides access to relay-level events including EOSE notifications.
